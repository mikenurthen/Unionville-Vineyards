## About the Project

Retained by Unionville to design and deliver sales reports for 3 specific sales categories.

Objective: How many glasses of wine, wine flights, and wine tastings were sold YTD across two locations, Ferry Market Wine Bar (New Hope, PA) and Unionville Tasting Room (Ringoes, NJ) in comparison to the same date range in 2024, 2023, 2022, and 2021?

Solution: Create a custom ETL script to merge, clean, and structure historical sales data from Shopify and POS systems.

  - The process began by extracting the full sales history from Unionville's e-commerce platform of choice, Shopify. All winery sales, ranging from online wine purchases to on-premise sales of cheese boards, sandwiches, and wine bottles purchased through their POS system ultimately transact through Shopify.
  - Loaded sales history across multiple CSV files and concatenated into a single dataset (DataFrame) to begin the data wrangling process using Pandas, an open-source data analysis and manipulation library built on top of NumPy.
  - Data wrangling techniques included filtering, grouping, and use of .ffill() and .bfill() methods across various columns within the sales orders. For example, various sales orders' columnar data, including `Location`, `Tax 1 Name`, and `Paid At` were intermittently missing or otherwise did not export.
  - Time series analysis requiring parsing separate datetime string formats and transforming into a single consistent datetime format for proper filtering, grouping, and joining.
